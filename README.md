## Development Stages
| Step | Process | Description |
| ---- | ------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Planning / Design | Figure out what features to implement and design how they should work. |
| 2 | Development & Testing | Write the initial code for the bot, and test parts of it as they are completed. |
| 3 | Testing | Test the bot in a controlled environment (a personal server) and ensure all the major features work. |
| 4 | Pre-Release Prep | Add the bot to the main server, and make all the necessary preparations needed for a high-user-count environment. |
| 5 | Pre-Release Broad Testing | At this point, the bot will be picking up messages and awarding XP for them. Monitor the bot to catch anything that pops up in a large environment. |
| 6 | Release | At this point, the bot will be announced to everyone in the server. All commands will be usable, and feedback will open in case anything not working properly is noticed. |
